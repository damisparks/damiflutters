# Dami Flutters
Consider it as my Flutter documentation. 

So, I started learning Flutter on 16 November 2020.

Why Flutters, 
Interesting question to ask. 
I heard and read it is a framework that gives the power of having your application on different 
platforms keeping a single codebase. I find it cool.

Why cool ? 
well i do not have to learn multiple languages for different platforms but instead learn one. 
I see it as a Google Translator or DeepL for application development. Does that makes ? 
Maybe not. To me it is logically and common sensible.


So today, November 17, 2020. 
I configured my laptop for Flutter development. 

I followed along some codelabs exercises.
